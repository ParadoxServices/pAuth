# pAuth
Sophisticated Authentication System built using Paradox fTokens and other measures.

Why should you use this authentication system?
Instead of token systems such as Discord's where if the token is stolen and used somewhere else it immeadiately logs the person in, our token system prevents that.
All authentication data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption so no one can steal the users data unless the host does something wrong.
